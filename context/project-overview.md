Project Overview Context
Project Summary
FULL DEV is a beginner-friendly full-stack e-commerce project.

The goal is to build a clean shopping experience where users can browse products, view product details, and eventually register and log in.

The project is split into two main applications:

backend/: Django REST Framework API
frontend/: React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS user interface
Use context/architecture-context.md for deeper technical details.

Current Product State
The project currently has:

A Django Product model
A DRF serializer for products
A backend product list endpoint
A React product listing page
A React product details page
Login and register pages in the frontend
Local mock product data in the frontend
Product images stored in the backend media/static image folder
The frontend is not yet connected to the backend product endpoint.

Main Goal
Build a simple e-commerce application where users can:

Browse products
View product details
Register an account
Log in
See product data from the backend API instead of hardcoded frontend mock data
Tech Stack
Frontend
React
Vite
JSX
Tailwind CSS
React Router DOM
Backend
Python
Django
Django REST Framework
PostgreSQL is currently configured in backend/backend/settings.py
Current Frontend Pages
Home Page
Route: /

Purpose:

Introduce the store
Show the hero section
Guide users toward browsing products
Display a small product preview when using shared product components
Products Page
Route: /products

Purpose:

Show the product collection
Currently uses local mock data from frontend/src/data/products.js
Should later fetch products from the backend
Product Details Page
Route: /products/:id

Purpose:

Show details for one product
Currently finds the product from local mock data using the route ID
Includes a not-found state when the ID does not match a mock product
Login Page
Route: /login

Purpose:

Provide a frontend sign-in screen
Backend login behavior is not implemented yet
Register Page
Route: /register

Purpose:

Provide a frontend account creation screen
Backend registration behavior is not implemented yet
Current Backend API
The implemented backend product route is:

GET /products/
It returns serialized Product records from the database.

The route is included at the Django root path, not under /api/.

Suggested future API routes can be added later, but prompts should not assume they already exist.

Product Data Shape
Backend Product Fields
The backend Product model currently uses:

id
product_name
product_price
brand
description
countInStock
image
createdAt
Frontend Mock Product Fields
The frontend mock products currently use:

id
name
price
image
description
Important Mapping
When connecting the frontend to the backend, map or normalize fields:

product_name should display as the product name.
product_price should display as the price.
image may need a backend base URL.
countInStock can support stock messaging later.
Near-Term Development Priorities
Keep the frontend responsive and readable.
Connect the product list page to GET /products/.
Connect the product details page to backend product data.
Add a backend single-product endpoint if needed.
Add CORS configuration if browser requests from Vite to Django are blocked.
Implement backend authentication only after the product flow is stable.
Move sensitive backend configuration into environment variables before production deployment.
Development Guidelines
Keep code beginner-friendly.
Prefer clear, explicit code over clever abstractions.
Reuse existing components before adding new ones.
Keep React components small and focused.
Keep Tailwind classes readable and consistent.
Do not add unnecessary dependencies.
Do not rename files or folders unless requested.
Do not assume routes exist; check Django URL files first.
Do not hardcode real credentials in frontend code.
Keep backend and frontend data shapes aligned.
Treat Documentation_FST/ as course/reference material, not production app code.
AI Assistant Instructions
When generating or modifying code for this project:

Read the relevant existing files first.
Match the current React, Django, and Tailwind patterns.
Use the actual route GET /products/ unless you intentionally update Django routing.
Mention when a route or feature is proposed but not implemented.
Avoid claiming authentication exists on the backend until it is added.
Avoid claiming frontend API integration exists until the mock data is replaced.
Keep changes scoped to the user's request.
Explain any field mapping between backend and frontend product data.
Prefer practical next steps over large architecture redesigns.
