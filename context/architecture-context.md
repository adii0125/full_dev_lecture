Architecture Context
Purpose
This file gives AI assistants the current technical shape of the FULL DEV project so future prompts can produce changes that match the existing codebase.

Use this context together with context/project-overview.md.

Current Status
FS_8 is an early-stage full-stack e-commerce learning project with a separate Django REST Framework backend and React frontend.

The backend currently exposes product data through a simple function-based DRF endpoint.

The frontend currently renders product pages from local mock data in frontend/src/data/products.js. It is not yet wired to the backend API.

Authentication pages exist in the frontend, but backend authentication endpoints are not implemented yet.

Generated and dependency folders such as frontend/node_modules/, frontend/dist/, venv/, and Python __pycache__/ folders should normally be ignored when reasoning about app code.

Backend Architecture
Stack
Python
Django
Django REST Framework
PostgreSQL configured in backend/backend/settings.py
Main app: base
Django Apps
backend/backend/ is the Django project package.

backend/base/ is the application package that currently owns product models, serializers, views, and URL routing.

Installed Apps
The project includes the default Django apps plus:

base
rest_framework
Database Configuration
backend/backend/settings.py is currently configured for PostgreSQL using Railway-style connection values.

Important prompting rule: do not assume SQLite is active just because db.sqlite3 exists. Check settings.py before changing database behavior.

Sensitive database values should eventually be moved to environment variables before production use.

Product Model
The only custom model currently found is Product in backend/base/models.py.

Current fields:

product_name
product_price
brand
description
countInStock
image
createdAt
The frontend mock data uses different names (name, price, image, description), so API integration will need field mapping or serializer/frontend changes.

Serializer
ProductSerializer in backend/base/serializers.py is a ModelSerializer using:

fields = "__all__"
Views
backend/base/views.py currently contains one function-based DRF view:

product_list(request)
Method: GET
Returns all products serialized with ProductSerializer
URL Routing
Root project routes in backend/backend/urls.py:

/admin/
includes base.urls at the root path
serves media files through static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT) during development
App routes in backend/base/urls.py:

GET /products/
There is currently no /api/ prefix in the implemented route.

Media Files
MEDIA_ROOT = "static/images"

MEDIA_URL = "/images/"

Product image uploads use:

upload_to="product_images/"
Existing product image files are stored under:

backend/static/images/product_images/
Frontend Architecture
Stack
React 19
Vite
Tailwind CSS 4 through @tailwindcss/vite
React Router DOM 7
ESLint
Routing
Routes are defined in frontend/src/App.jsx.

Current frontend routes:

/
/products
/products/:id
/login
/register
BrowserRouter is set up in frontend/src/main.jsx.

Data Source
Product UI currently reads from:

frontend/src/data/products.js
This is temporary mock data. It imports the same local hero image for every product.

Backend integration is a planned next step. When integrating, use the actual backend endpoint currently available at GET /products/ unless the backend route is changed intentionally.

Component Structure
Shared UI components:

Header.jsx
Footer.jsx
ProductList.jsx
ShopGuide.jsx
Pages:

Home.jsx
Products.jsx
ProductDetails.jsx
Login.jsx
Register.jsx
Styling
The frontend uses Tailwind utility classes directly in JSX.

Current visual style is simple, clean, responsive, and beginner-friendly.

Keep styles consistent with existing colors, spacing, and component patterns unless the user asks for a redesign.

Integration Notes
When connecting frontend products to backend data:

Use the implemented backend route first: GET /products/.
Add CORS support only if the frontend and backend run on different origins and browser requests are blocked.
Avoid inventing /api/products/ unless the Django routes are also updated.
Map backend fields to frontend display fields carefully:
product_name -> name
product_price -> price
image -> image
description -> description
Backend image URLs may be relative to MEDIA_URL; frontend code may need to prepend the backend base URL.
Architecture Rules For Future Prompts
Keep the architecture beginner-friendly.
Prefer small, clear changes over broad rewrites.
Match the existing file names and folder structure.
Do not rename model fields, routes, or components unless the user asks or the migration plan is included.
Do not add new libraries unless they solve a real current need.
Prefer existing React components before creating new ones.
Keep backend routes and frontend API calls aligned.
Check actual code before claiming a feature exists.
Treat Documentation_FST/ as learning/reference material, not runtime app code.
Keep generated folders and dependencies out of architecture summaries.
